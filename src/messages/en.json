      {
        "question": "How many tokens can I buy?",
        "answer": "You can purchase the amount you consider appropriate within the range enabled in the presale, always subject to current stock availability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What payment methods are available?",
        "answer": "Payments are made exclusively onchain on the Ethereum network. You can use MetaMask or Rabby to complete your purchase with USDT. We do not accept payments with traditional currencies or other payment processors."
      },
      {
        "question": "When will I receive my tokens?",
        "answer": "Great news! Tokens are automatically released at the time of purchase through the smart contract interaction. You don't need to wait days or manual processes: once you confirm the transaction in your wallet, ENSCL tokens will arrive instantly to your address. It's that simple and transparent thanks to blockchain technology."
      },
      {
        "question": "Where will I receive my tokens?",
        "answer": "Tokens will be automatically received in the wallet you have connected on the landing page at the time of purchase. Make sure you have the correct wallet connected before confirming your transaction."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I exchange my tokens after purchasing them?",
        "answer": "Once the presale is finished, you will be able to exchange your ENSCL tokens directly on Uniswap v4. To ensure there is always liquidity available for operations, we will allocate 1% of all funds raised during the presale to create and maintain liquidity pools on this platform. This will allow you to buy and sell your tokens easily and safely when needed."
      },
      {
        "question": "What backs the value of EnsChile?",
        "answer": "EnsChile is backed by a diversified portfolio of more than 500 ENS domains on Ethereum. Of this collection, approximately 300 are prepunks with numbers below 3000, representing high-value digital assets within the ENS ecosystem. This solid base of domains provides a tangible and valuable foundation for the project."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are ENS domains kept active in the long term?",
        "answer": "ENS domains have a limited validity period and require periodic renewal to remain active. To ensure that our domain collection remains protected and operational, we dedicate 1% of all presale revenue to an automatic renewal fund. This mechanism ensures that domains nearing expiration are automatically renewed, thus protecting the value and integrity of the assets backing the project."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I participate in the profits generated by the domains?",
        "answer": "All profits generated from the sale or rental of ENS domains will be distributed among ENSCL token holders automatically. A smart contract will calculate and distribute your corresponding share based on the number of tokens you have in your wallet. The more tokens you own, the greater your participation in the profits. This process is completely transparent and works without intermediaries, ensuring that each person receives their fair share proportionally and in a decentralized manner."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I participate in project decisions?",
        "answer": "Yes, absolutely. ENSCL tokens grant you the right to be part of a decentralized autonomous organization that will be managed through Tally. Through smart contracts, you will be able to vote and propose actions related to a portion of EnSchile's assets. Each decision is executed directly on the blockchain, which means your voice counts and winning proposals are automatically implemented without the need for intermediaries. Additionally, as an active member of the organization, you will receive a share of the benefits generated by operations performed with those assets."
